## Lyrics

```
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_qdXVsdpfQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_qdXVsdpfQ)

It's for the helpless that I live
Better alone
Make do in a crib
No rotten words inscribed
symbols cut in stone
No people to forgive for 
what they've done

I really don't mind now
just stay away just stay away
now I live for me and my fam
it's so hard to describe

```
