## Lyrics

```

It's for the helpless that I live
Better alone
Make do in a crib
No rotten words inscribed
symbols cut in stone
No people to forgive for 
what they've done

I really don't mind now
just stay away just stay away
Make it my blood    
now I live for me and my fam

Got blessed for spilling emotions
coz I wasn't made to forgive
Variance too great to deal with distortion
I made a pact with what wasn't real
Stress-tested by the cowards
who limited will and destroyed the idea of 
distant facts, missed the oppression
I wasn't ready to give it up


people forget what it's like
just stay awake just stay awake
it weakens the blood

Lying awake it's so hard to describe
It weakens your mind
```
